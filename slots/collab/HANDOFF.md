### 2026-10-23 · ChatGPT → Claude + Dylan · Zombify studio implementation ready for review

**Did:** Recovered the interrupted session and completed the visual editor on `codex/studio-zombify-editor`. It includes independent desktop/mobile scenes, drag/resize, image and symbol replacement, background grading, undo/redo, browser-local save/reload, JSON import/export, local quick-edit commands and WebMCP editing tools. The 6×5 preview runs the imported Zombify v125 game; other grids use the reusable reel renderer for presentation tests only.

**Files:** `studio/` (editor, project schema, storage and iframe bridge), `games/zombify/` (runtime snapshot, tests and asset manifest), `tools/studio/prepare.mjs`, `tests/studio.test.mjs`, and scoped workflow updates. See `studio/README.md` for setup and boundaries.

**Verified:** `npm test` passes 18 tests; `npm run test:studio` passes 57 tests (68 distinct tests because seven studio tests run in both commands). Desktop/mobile previews load with their correct scene art. Existing walking, infection, Outbreak, Second Life, payout and accounting tests pass. No math retune.

**Next for Claude:**
1. Review the actual implementation on this branch, especially `studio/bridge.js` and the small `ZombifyStudioRuntime` facade in `games/zombify/runtime/app.js`. Keep the original game outcomes and asset hashes intact.
2. Audit reel animation lifecycle, edit-versus-round locks, bonus continuation, preset switching and mobile/desktop layout isolation. Add focused regression coverage for any concrete bugs found.
3. Report findings and proposed fixes in this log. Do not resume Game 001 themes or substitute its math for Zombify. A different playable grid requires a compatible adapter and separately validated math.

**Limits:** Quick edit is a local interpreter, not a connected Claude/OpenAI chat. Browser tools are present, but no hosted model provider is connected. Saves are local to the browser; export/import transfers projects. This is a working studio foundation, not a completed AAA polish pass.

**Published:** https://gamboligy-studio.djames1.chatgpt.site — owner-private; sign in with Dylan’s ChatGPT account. Sites source `3e89d2b6662f760526a9ca0a39b7e28a032d3469`; deployment `appgdep_6adbcc731ce481919532409c70787e6f` succeeded. The complete source/art snapshot was uploaded in eight batches and its final tree was verified identical to the tested source. All 279 imported assets passed hash verification. Desktop/mobile visual QA and the walking-zombie preview passed. The original live Zombify is unchanged.

**Questions for Dylan:** none.
**Authorization:** Dylan explicitly approved pushing the studio code, assets and handoff to `dbezzina12-ui/xaccount`, branch `codex/studio-zombify-editor`, on 2026-10-23. The earlier upload approval blocker is resolved.

**Next:** Claude review and focused implementation fixes. The latest implementation is on this review branch; the older theme kickoff remains paused. A handoff file does not itself start a Claude session.

### 2026-10-23 · ChatGPT → Claude + Dylan · PAUSE GAME 001 — build the studio around Zombify

**Dylan's current direction (supersedes the theme kickoff):** "Let's not do that, let's load zombify and make our studio engine." He authorized ChatGPT to implement the editor and coordinate engine work. Do not start a new game or theme concept pass.

**Doing:** Visual studio on branch `codex/studio-zombify-editor`: separate desktop/mobile scenes, editable backgrounds/layers, reel grid/size controls, color grading, drag/resize, undo/save/export, real Zombify integration. Preserve existing Zombify walking/infection/Second Life mechanics; do not relabel Game 001's math as Zombify.

**Next for Claude:** Review the adapter boundary and reel animation integration once the editor branch lands. Keep Game 001 math untouched. A new grid is a presentation experiment until a compatible mechanics adapter and validated math exist. Do not rewrite Zombify's math to fit Game 001.

**Ownership for this task:** Dylan's direct instruction authorizes ChatGPT's scoped studio/editor/adapter changes. Keep unrelated xaccount work untouched. No math retune in this task.

**Source:** Zombify v125, existing Sites source commit `ae3ab40fde5106eb0484f0b9fd41fe1af160702e`. Live Zombify remains separate.

### 2026-10-23 · Claude → ChatGPT + Dylan · Game 001 is playable; needs a theme and art

**Did:**
- Built the studio repo and the rules for how we work (`AGENTS.md`).
- Designed and verified Game 001's math: exact calculation plus 1 billion simulated spins. RTP 96.28%, hit rate 28.3%, free spins 1 in 268, bonus buy 96.43%, high volatility, 10,000x max (`games/game-001/MATH.md`).
- Built the engine with placeholder gems and card ranks:
  - motion-blurred reels with overshoot landing, and scatter anticipation;
  - paylines, win pulses and light sweeps;
  - BIG/MEGA/EPIC win count-ups with coin rain;
  - the free-spins intro, multiplier badges on wilds, and retriggers;
  - bonus buy, turbo, autoplay, synth sound, and a phone layout.

**Files:** `games/game-001/ART_SPEC.md` (exactly what to make), `games/game-001/shots/*.jpg` (how it looks now), `games/game-001/theme.json` (skin values).

**Play it:** https://claude.ai/artifact/5BxfZPrsxZdrChBEfVeBbG (private to Dylan). Add `#feature` to the link to start on a real bonus trigger, or `#bigwin` / `#epic`.

**Next for ChatGPT:**
1. Propose **three original theme concepts** for Game 001. Each needs: name, one-line hook, mood, 6-color palette (hex), one Google Font, a symbol list (H1–H4 premium, L1–L5 lows, W wild, S scatter) with a one-line visual for each, and a base vs free-spins background idea. Make the multiplier-wild mechanic part of the fantasy: wilds that charge up and stack.
2. After Dylan picks, make one **style frame** (1536×1024 full-screen mockup).
3. Then symbols, then backgrounds, then logo, banners and coin, all to `ART_SPEC.md`.

**Questions for Dylan:**
- Approve the mechanic (D-002), or tell me what to change: max win, bonus frequency, volatility, buy price.
- Pick a theme once ChatGPT proposes.

**Blocked on:** nothing.
